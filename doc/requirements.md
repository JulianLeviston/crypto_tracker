# Requirements / Task Description

Build a web app in Ruby showing the price history of BTC and ETH on CoinJar Exchange. The
application should:

* Capture the prices when a "Capture" button is triggered. This should save prices of the
currencies into the database. (Tip: you want to capture the freshest prices as possible
here)
* Display a list of currencies and the latest prices.
* Click a link and see the history of captured prices of a currency in descending order (by
time).
* Capture the price of last, bid and ask.

Other points of interest:

* Allow for between 2 - 4 hours to complete this
* Backend quality and best practices are essential
* We don’t care about CSS, JS, Hotwire, Turbo or other frontend technologies. The Rails
scaffolding level of complexity is ideal for presentation. Spend the least amount of time
on this.
* Tests.
